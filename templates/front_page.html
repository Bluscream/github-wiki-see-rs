    <h1>GitHub Wiki SEE</h1>
    <p>
        <em>GitHub Wiki Search Engine Enablement</em> (GHWSEE) allows non-indexed GitHub Wikis to be indexed by search
        engines. The <a href="/robots.txt"><code>robots.txt</code></a> and <a
            href="https://github.com/github/feedback/discussions/4992#discussioncomment-1448177">headers</a> on this
        site do not prevent indexing of wiki content and GitHub Wiki content proxied from GitHub and served from this
        service can be crawled and indexed by major search engines.
    </p>
    <p> Currently, <a href=https://github.com/github/feedback/discussions/4992>GitHub prevents crawling of repository
            wiki content</a> for wikis that are publically editable and some other unknown criteria(s) such as lack of
        stars. You can find some direct GitHub.com Wiki content on search engines such as Google and DuckDuckGo but not
        all. This negatively impacts the effectiveness of FAQs and other knowledge bases on GitHub Wikis and also
        negatively impacts users who search for information that may only be found on those GitHub Wikis that do not
        meet GitHub's currently ambiguious criteria.</p>
    <p> GHWSEE proxies the rendered contents of the pages and has a link with a large button at the top to visit the
        page on GitHub for everyday usage and a link at the bottom explaining what GHWSEE is. The content of this
        service is not meant to be read directly by users and is intended for crawlers. GHWSEE is designed to behave
        like those StackOverflow content mirroring sites that rank high with "stolen" content from StackOverflow but
        with far less ad-farming. Unlike its inspiration, GHWSEE has no ads and tries to make it obvious, quick, and
        easy for users to get to the content they want directly on GitHub.com short of an automatic redirect that may
        make search engines not crawl the content.</p>
    <p> Another purpose of GHWSEE is to bring awareness to the issue of GitHub Wikis purposefully not being indexed.
        Many are caught off-guard and have produced massive libraries of information that they are unaware of being
        generally invisible to the internet. Likewise, many searching for information in these libraries are not aware
        that the information is invisible to them if it was in a GitHub Wiki.</p>
    <p> If you are a GitHub Wiki maintainer, you may want to consider GitHub Pages backed by a public repository for
        your community's content as a more crawlable, stable, blessed, and probably higher search ranking alternative.

            alternative is also mentioned in GitHub Docs about GitHub Wikis</a>. <a
            href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/website/pull/109">Consider adding an "<em>Edit on GitHub</em>" link to the
            content on GitHub Pages to have an experience closer to wikis, easily permit editing, and to encourage
            contributions</a>. This is the official solution which can be burdensome and you are welcome to continue <a
            href="#usage">using</a> GHWSEE.</a>
    </p>
    <p> If you are interested in providing feedback to GitHub or seeing what GitHub staff has said about their blocking
        of Wiki content from appearing in search engines, participate in the discussion here: <a
            href="https://github.com/github/feedback/discussions/4992">https://github.com/github/feedback/discussions/4992</a>.
        Let us hope that GitHub can find a solution to unblock GitHub Wiki content in harmony with their SEO concerns,
        and GHWSEE can be <a href="#decommissioning">decommissioned</a>. After 9 years, <a
            href="https://github.com/github/feedback/discussions/4992#discussioncomment-1885558">GitHub does appear to
            be privately experimenting letting some GitHub Wikis to be indexed if they meet some sort of criteria such
            as public non-editability and possibly a number of stars requirement, but the exact criteria is currently
            unknown.</a></p>
    <p> For anti-abuse reasons, all links rendered in the service that are going out of GitHub are tagged with
        <code>rel="nofollow ugc"</code> as to not affect search engine rankings or to promote mass vandalism of GitHub
        Wikis. This is in addition to <code>rel="nofollow"</code> in the original content.
    </p>
    <h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Wiki Reader: Use your favorite search engine! That is the intended interface to the content "on" this
            service and to get a link to the original GitHub content. Do not read the content on this site as it may
            have rendered with errors and is only meant for robots. Go directly to the original page on GitHub.</li>
        <li>Wiki Editor: If you are a GitHub Wiki contributor, simply edit your content periodically and the <a
                href=https://github.com/nelsonjchen/github-wiki-see-rs-sitemaps>sitemap generator</a> will eventually
            pick it up and notify search engines. Because this just isn't GitHub.com, don't expect a high ranking as
            your content will probably be on page 2, 3, or worse. That is still much better than the previous
            alternative of not being in the search results at all! Note that it may take quite some time for content to
            be picked up and there is no guarantee it will be picked up.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>If you would like to greatly increase the chances and ranking of your GitHub Wiki content being indexed,
                consider adding a link to your content on GHWSEE to a location where search engines can index. For an
                example of this in action, see how the <a
                    href="https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer#main_mister-main-binary-and-wiki-repo">MiSTer
                    historical computing and gaming recreation project linked a "crawlable wiki" that GHWSEE serves in
                    their README on GitHub which can be indexed</a>. </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

        So far, about $300 have been spent on experiments, queries, and so on with this service during its initial
        ramp-up. The good news is that the cost to currently host the service is very low. In leiu of any compensation,
        please consider donating money recurringly or one-time to the <a href="https://archive.org">Internet Archive</a>
        and/or your time to <a href="https://archiveteam.org">Archive Team</a> projects.
    </p>
    <h2 id="decommissioning">Decommissioning</h2>
    <p>This site will be decommissioned to redirect old links once the block is lifted or GitHub produces some other
        solution to index GitHub Wikis in harmony with their SEO concerns.</p>
    <p>People shouldn't have linked to this site but maybe the warnings weren't big and red enough. <a
            href="https://github.com/nelsonjchen/github-wiki-see-rs/issues/6">Flashing yellow was very unpopular.</a>
