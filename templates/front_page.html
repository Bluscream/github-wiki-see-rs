    <h1>GitHub Wiki SEE (decomissioned)</h1>
    <p>
        <em>GitHub Wiki Search Engine Enablement</em> previously allowed GitHub Wikis to be indexed by search engines.
        There was no <a href="/robots.txt"><code>robots.txt</code></a> on this site preventing indexing of wiki content
        and wiki content proxied from GitHub and served from this domain will be crawled and indexed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Previously, <a href=https://github.com/github/feedback/discussions/4992>GitHub prevented crawling of repository Wiki
        pages</a>. This means GitHub Wikis are invisible to search engines such as Google and DuckDuckGo and were an
        a very unpleasant surprise if you're looking to share searchable knowledge or put a FAQ on a Wiki!
    </p>
    <p>
        GHWSEE had simply proxied the rendered contents of the pages and has a link at the top to visit the page on GitHub
        for normal usage and a link at the bottom explaining what GHWSEE is.
        The content of this service was not meant to be read by users and was meant for crawlers. It was
        intended to behave like those StackOverflow content mirroring sites but with far less ad-farming.
    </p>
    <p>
        For anti-abuse reasons, all links rendered in the service that are going out of GitHub
        are tagged with <code>rel="nofollow ugc"</code> as to not affect search engine rankings
        or to promote mass vandalism of GitHub Wikis. This was likely the original reason for
        the indexing blocking.
    </p>
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Used a search engine! That was the intended interface to the content "on" this site.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you were an editor, you edited your page periodically and the
        <a href=https://github.com/nelsonjchen/github-wiki-see-rs-sitemaps>sitemap generator</a>
        will eventually pick it up and notify search engines! Some stuff ranked pretty high but it wasn't
        a slam dunk to be "number 1".
    </p>

    <p>Note that it had taken quite some time for content to be picked up and there is no guarantee it'll be picked up.</p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p> These were examples and testing wikis but they just redirect to GitHub now.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="/m/nelsonjchen/github-wiki-test/wiki">nelsonjchen/github-wiki-test</a></li>
        <li><a href="/m/commaai/openpilot/wiki">commaai/openpilot</a></li>
        <li><a href="/m/Erithano/Timon-Your-FAQ-bot-for-Microsoft-Teams/wiki">Erithano/Timon-Your-FAQ-bot-for-Microsoft-Teams</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Project, README, Source, Issues, and other information</h2>
    <p>The project was extensively decomissioned but you can look at its Git history.</p>
